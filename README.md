# Introduction

Currently I am learing bazel and I decide to create some guide as reference.   
In repository you will find various projects, (directories) the numbers refer to the degree of difficulty.  
In each directory you will find a `README` file, which describes the individual steps taken during the creation process.  

This guide is intended to help me with basic Bazel projects.  

### Basic terminology
